"""
This Python script powers a Streamlit web application designed for an innovative interaction with a plant.
The app integrates with a MySQL database to retrieve real-time data about the plant's physiological and
environmental conditions. It utilizes the PandasAI library, which in turn employs OpenAI's language models,
to enable users to 'chat' with the plant. The script fetches and displays various metrics such as root and
leaf conductivity, humidity, temperature, and other environmental factors. It offers a unique user
experience by allowing queries to be posed to the plant, which are then answered based on the collected
data, simulating a conversation. The application also includes visualizations of the data using Matplotlib
and manages environment variables for secure API and database access.
