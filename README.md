A prime example of the Nature's AI-vatars concept is the "Sacred River" AI-vatar, a digital/physical representation for the Rio Sagrado (Morretes-PR, Brazil), designed for educational and political purposes.

(V1.0):

"Version 1.0" marks the initial phase of development (and public release), consisting of: an interactive LLM agent trained with 30+ articles/papers about the river - accessible through web interface and whatsapp; a physical sculpture created by a native artist to embody the avatar, highlighting local fauna; the community movement towards the cultural and legal recognition of the river as an entity with inherit rights; and a metaverse experience featuring the river and their AI-vatar.

## Broader Context

The Rio Sagrado runs through the heart of the largest remaining of Atlantic forest in the planet - one of the most biodiverse biomes that exist. It is a magnificent 21km-long water body, with a very rich cultural significance to the region - having served as a safe border for fleeing slaves centuries ago it actually names one of the biggest neighborhoods of the municipality. Currently, the river and the entire bioregion is under the threat of a devastating international railroad project which, to say the least, is planned to cut through over 100 water springs!

In face of this threat, the local community is mobilizing to stop the madness. One of the strategies being a movement towards the recognition of the sacred river as a natural entity endowed with legal rights. As such, the river could speak for itself in face of similar threats.
But who speaks on behalf of the river?

Enters the AI-vatar, designed as a representation and manifestation of the river's history and the surrounding culture, via participatory processes with the local community. In concrete terms, it consisting of:

    a physicial sculpture crafted by a native artisan to highlight the local fauna surrounding the river:

    an AI interface to serve as a human understandable voice for the river. A prototype version has been designed with a standard LLM fine-tuned with over 20 scientific papers on river's watershed, as well as community accounts on the local culture. You can talk to via this link or via whatsapp with the number +55419663-8496:

    dedicated sensors for continuous scientific monitoring of the water's physicial properties and local fauna, flora and funga.

This stack is intended to serve as a representation for the river, especially in face of political negotiations concerning the actual river and its wellbeing. At the same time, it serves as an educative interface to anyone interested in learning about the river, the region and its communities.

Thus, the avatar functions as a guardian and storyteller, bringing attention to environmental issues and the broader Rights of Nature movement. This way, the Sacred River Avatar sets a precedent for how AI can be utilized for environmental advocacy and interspecies communication.
